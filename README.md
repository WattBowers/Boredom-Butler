# The Boredom Butler

## Details

This project is built using React and the ImDb Api, it is hosted using Heroku. This app was a project Idea I had after finding the ImDb api. Search by decade, ImDb rating, and genre, and the website will give you a TV or movie recomendation. Along with a brief description, and a list of actors and the director associated with the film.  

### What I learned

My biggest take away from this project was how to write React in a more modern style. Instead of using the older Class based components I decided to learn how to use hooks to clean up my code, and create more readable, and navigatable code. I also learned a lot about using git and how useful breaking up even small projects into different branches can make saving work along different levels of progress a breeze. Lastly, I discovered why reactive code is so important. The website still needs modifications to increase its ease of use on mobile, however ive learned a lot about using CSS media queries and proper sizing to change layouts depending on screen size. 

### Getting this to run

This website is hosted on Heroku. Feel free to clone the code and see how I built it. you will need your own imDb key to use the api. 

If you just want to play around in the live site here is the link: https://the-boredom-butler.herokuapp.com/

Because I am using the free Heroku service the website can take some time to load. You may have to wait up to ten seconds depending on your connection.
